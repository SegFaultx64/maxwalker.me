I am pretty sure software engineers are currently experiencing a version of the myth where the inventor of the guillotine was the first victim of it. If LLM-based AI is going to automate away white collar work (still unclear) it will almost certainly hit software development first. The rate of improvement of LLMs at producing functional, useful code is staggering. A lot of my friends and colleuges in the industry seem to be in denial about this, but I would say something like 80-90% of the code "I" write at this point is generated by an LLM. At this point it seems like there are only two ways most software engineers are not imminently obsoleted: 1) there is some hard ceiling we haven't hit yet; or 2) the economics of running gpus somehow proves to be worse that that of running humans. Option 1 seems like praying for dues ex machina salvation (from the machina), and it's hard to see how option 2 could possibly bear out in reality. So then the question is, what's going to happen to software engineers (and software engineering)?

The _Other_ Way AI Destroys the World

An excess of ink has been spilled about the risk of AI, usually framed as the risk of artificial super intelligence becoming misaligned and exterminating humanity (See https://ai-2027.com/, etc). While there are much smarter and more qualified people then me that argue this scenario is something we absolutely need to be worried about it all feels a bit distant and sci fi to me, making it easy for me to brush off. However over the last 9 months or so I think a dark horse contender for an apocalyptic or at least horrifying bad outcome has arisen. So far AI Psychosis seems like a much more concrete contender wrecking society. Worse yet, it seems like most people are not yet taking it seriously.

- Humans love to personify things, which is why evil ASI overlords are sexy, and ironically why AI Psychosis is such a problem
- Questions to answer in the first few paras:
	- What is AI Psychosis?
	- Is AI inducing psychosis or triggering it?
- Premise / thoughts to tease out:
	- If you thought social media was bad
	- We are about to subject everyone to a severe Ayahuasca trip and see what happens
		- We are opening the door to people experiencing a completely separate reality on demand.
- Full automated luxury space Folie a deux
- Concerning premise: LLMs are much closer to how human cognition works that we currently believe and so what we are seeing as AI psychosis is basically a direct analogue of what happens when the context window gets polluted and full
	- This maybe is a better core premise, even if it's impossible to verify

What's So Bad About Being Rational Anyway?

If you've spent a lot of time in tech-adjacent or psuedointellectual corners of the internet you have almost certainly run into rationalists or at least their ideology. Tech-bro philosopher-would-be-kings are currently having their moment in the sun, so I wanted to articulate why a harbour a visceral distaste for these folks. The AI-circles are especially full of adherents of this ideology and it's more severe spin off "Effective Altrusim" (EA). Frustatingly, from the perspective of a hater like myself, "Rationalists" are right about many of the things they espouse. Even the EA whackos  make some solid points, doomsday murder cults not withstanding. But there is an underlying rot in their world view that seems like it inevitably will become more problematic as their continue to amass political power and intellectual legitimacy.

The Zen and Art of Suffering: how being good at being miserable can make you a better founder

Suffering is a learned skill, or at least that’s how people in the Mountaineering / Alpinism / Climbing circles talk about it. Of all the ideas I have been exposed to since the end of my first company, this one is the most intriguing, especially when viewed through the lens of a startup founder. I spent an awful lot of time being vaguely miserable, trying to find product market fit and get my company off the ground. Even though I may have put in 10,000 hours, they weren’t focused practice. I didn’t get any better at suffering.
Why you need to get good at suffering

The reason Mountaineers fixate on suffering is simple: climbing a mountain is a huge amount of work for an often small chance of a payoff. You spend a lot of time trying to get to the top and a lot of time trying to get down. Then, you probably stand on the summit for 5 to 10 minutes, only a few minutes out of days or weeks of toil and months and months of training. This is what we call “Type 2 Fun,” things that are only fun when you're looking back on them.

Startups are similar in many ways. While at times things may move unbearably quickly, most of the time they’re barely moving at all. Long hours of work appear to be pushing you and your company no closer to your goals. Like mountain climbing, startups are a slog and you’re often unsure of your own ability to succeed. It’s important to get good at this sort of suffering as a founder since it’s going to happen a lot.

Simply quietly being miserable is not productive for your company and it’s really detrimental to your mental health

Before you accuse me of promoting a cut-rate version of stoicism, where everyone should just shut up and quit whining, I’m actually talking about the opposite. Simply quietly being miserable is not productive for your company and it’s really detrimental to your mental health. This is essentially what I did when starting my first company. I tried to just “tough it out” and this is a big part of why I didn’t get any better at suffering, even if I did it a lot.
How can you get better at suffering, and at running your company?
#1 "Why am I doing this?"

This is a question I asked myself many times when starting my first company as well as while trying to climb mountains. The thing I failed to internalize when I was starting my company is that I knew the answer. It’s the same answer when getting snowed on in the middle of summer trying to reach some summit. I was starting a company because I wanted to.

No one made me found a company. It was a path I had set for myself. Reminding yourself that starting a company is something that you want to do can go a long way to building resilience when faced with inevitable challenges. Once you get good at this, it will become a lot easier to bounce back when you hit the things that suck about starting a company.
#2 You can turn back

You have the option to bail. In climbing, knowing when to turn back is a critical, lifesaving skill. In startups it’s more about not needlessly dragging things out when they aren’t working. Before I decided to pursue an acquisition for my first company I spent a long time feeling like there was nothing I could do and I was stuck running the company. While I think you have some obligation to your investors, cofounders, and team there are definitely times where the right choice is to call it and move on. Our investors were surprisingly understanding of our decision to sell the company.

If you’re at a dead end, there’s no point trying to flail around with a company that’s making you miserable

Even though this tweet was mocked, the core point is solid: If you’re at a dead end, there’s no point trying to flail around with a company that’s making you miserable and definitely not going ever make anyone money. Developing a sense of when it’s the right choice to give up goes a long way. Sometimes it’s not about giving up on a company entirely, it’s about letting go of things that aren’t working or adjusting your expectations. Maybe you aren’t making it to the summit today, but you could make it to that awesome lookout over there.
#3 Suffering is not a competition

Finally I’ve learned not to compare how bad a time I’m having to others, but instead to find people whose support I can rely on. Many times on a trek or a climb I will find myself getting frustrated by how much easier it seems for “that person over there”, which is not only unproductive but just plain silly. It ignores all the times I was the one who was casually walking up something that other people were really struggling with, and without getting too philosophical or preachy, really there is no fairness to what is easy or hard for different people. Them’s just the breaks.
quote

Find other founders and collectively share your suffering ... it will probably make you feel better.

A real game changer though for both entrepreneurs and climbers is to find someone to build camaraderie in your suffering with. I have been on a lot of outdoor outings where things were going so comically awfully that we had more fun joking about that than we were ever going to have on climb. Find other founders and collectively share your suffering and even if it doesn’t help it will probably make you feel better.

How to build a digital TCG

The purpose of this series of blog posts is to capture and clearly articulate, as best I can, my understanding of how to build a **digital trading card game** from the ground up, from first principles. As to why you should listen to me: I played a **hysterically** offensive amount of *Magic: The Gathering* over the course of my youth and early adulthood. I am friends with a bunch of professional Magic players, people that went on to design very major trading card games, for example people that worked on *Flesh and Blood* and lots of other games.

I've built several **digital trading card games** myself, mostly as a contract developer, so I can't really talk about the exact games. My background is in software engineering; I've done all sorts of things, but one of the things that's always been the most interesting to me is, how do you build a trading card game? What does it mean to build a trading card game? 

This series is really supposed to be not a tutorial, not what code do I type in order to have a working trading card game in Unity or whatever, but an overview of the hard stuff as I understand it in trading card games. The things that are difficult to figure out, the things that are difficult to make work correctly, the concepts that, if you don't get them right up front, are going to make the game not work, not scale, and not function correctly. 

Really, at its core, the idea of this series is: if you sat down with a **blank canvas** and set out to implement a digital trading card game today, how would you do it? I think that it's kind of a daunting problem. Obviously, any engineering challenge is hardest when you're looking at a blank canvas and trying to figure out how you build something from scratch, especially if it's something you've never built before. 

But I think that specifically, trading card games, due to their combination of extremely *pernicious complexity* of interaction between different cards, gameplay mechanics, rules, and the sort of arbitrariness of the cards, combined with the fact that from a game design or, I guess, a game implementation perspective, they look fairly simple—right?—it's just rectangles of digital cardboard moving around. 

I think those things combine to create a situation where it is really easy for people who set out to do this to not understand what the actual challenges are in a trading card game and to not understand how to overcome them. So my goal here is to take what I think is a pretty solid understanding that I have and articulate that in such a way that other folks can leverage that information and not make some of the mistakes that I've made when doing this on several occasions.

Before we get into the meat of this, one final note is that when I'm talking about **digital trading card games**, I really mean **digital card games**. I think that a lot of the concepts here would apply if you were building a *rogue-lite deck builder* or something like *Slay the Spire*. They would apply if you were building a game that was sort of inspired by trading card games but not directly a trading card game itself. You can look at games like **Faeria** or **Prismata** which are pretty discernibly not trading card games in the traditional sense but are inspired by them. A lot of these concepts are very similar. Obviously, every game is different. Obviously, every game has different rules and systems and things like that, but the core premises of a game are going to persist across these.

## What is the theoretical game we are building?

So a good construct for framing this is if we're going to build a specific game, what is the game that we're going to build? I think that a lot of this stuff is very abstract, and it can be hard to articulate it clearly if you're talking about across all these different games with all these different permutations of rules and structures and things like that.

So, for the purposes of this blog series, we're going to mostly assume that we have a game that is roughly similar mechanically to a game like **_Hearthstone_**. Where there are decks of cards, there's a playing area, battlefield, whatever you want to call it. There are minions, monster, unit, creature cards, whatever you want to call them, that come into play, stay in play, and do combat. 

There are spell cards, skill cards, or action cards, or whatever you would call them, that are ephemeral things that happen and cease to exist, go to discard, whatever. I think that as we go through the series, there will be callouts for "this isn't the game that we're building," but if you were building a game like this, you would do X, Y, or Z.

But fundamentally, the idea is two players taking alternating turns, playing things from their hand. It's not that there isn't a way to extend all these concepts to implement other things; it's just that that's the easiest framework in which to operate. The fundamental concepts here are pretty scalable across other approaches. 

You could build a game with real-time alternating actions between players, you could build a game with a lot of other things. At its core, a game like the **_Bazaar_** is actually still, in many ways, a trading card game. So it's very possible to build a very different game with these concepts, but for the purposes of this, we're going to assume that you basically have that core, I think, minimalist trading card game structure and then go from there.

## What are the foundational objects of a digital TCG

When we think about a trading card game, it's useful to consider what the objects being manipulated or existing in the game are. You can think about this as **_object-oriented programming_**. While it's not necessary to frame it that way, fundamentally, there's a set of objects that act on each other or are acted upon, and that’s the easiest way to conceptualize the game.

The first and most obvious object in any card game is **cards**. Cards exist in the player's deck, hand, board, or other areas. They are the foundational unit of the game. When considering cards in a digital trading card game, it's important to view not just the specific card that exists in your hand, but also the card in the abstract. For example, in **_Magic: The Gathering_**, there's the card **Lightning Bolt**, which is a specific card that says "deal three damage to target creature or player." There’s also a copy of **Lightning Bolt** that exists in your hand. The nomenclature used by **Magic** players differentiates between a copy of a card in your hand versus the actual card itself, as the card represents the **platonic ideal** of its functionality, cost, and rarity. The actual card that exists in your hand is an instance drawn from that ideal.

An interesting aspect of a game like **Magic**, designed for paper play, is that cards reset to their platonic ideal instead of persisting through events. For instance, if you play a copy of **Lightning Bolt** and then return it to your hand, it is treated as a new card from the game's perspective. Digital games, however, like **_Hearthstone_**, can retain buffs on a minion across various states—if a minion dies and returns to your hand, it can keep its buffs. This is because digital games can track the state of cards effectively without the limitations present in paper games. For example, **Eternal**, developed by Direwolf Digital, has a mechanic called **Warcry** that buffs cards in your deck without needing to identify the top card.

Thus, cards are the most foundational concept, with two key perspectives: the abstract rule set and the instance of the card in play. 

Another very obvious concept of an object that exists in the world of a card game is the **player**. In some games, players have direct representatives in play; in others, they do not. For instance, in **_Hearthstone_**, the hero serves as the representative of the player. In **Magic**, the player has a life total that is reduced over time. Many games involve players taking damage, causing them to lose the game. There are games like **Netrunner** where players aren't directly represented; they attack other entities instead. Still, the player exists as the individual acting on cards and holding cards in their hand.

The third foundational object is much less obvious: **zones**. While this terminology is used in **Magic**, other games may have different names for them. Zones are the places in which cards exist. Generally, cards can be thought of as always being in exactly one zone. Although this is a big generalization and some games may challenge this premise, for almost any game, you can map zones to their aspects. In **Magic**, zones include your hand, deck, battlefield, stack, graveyard, etc. You can apply this model to **Hearthstone**, which has zones like deck zone, hand zone, and battlefield zone, even if they don’t explicitly identify them as such. Though **Hearthstone** doesn’t have a discard pile that can be manually searched, cards still have a defined place—a discard zone—when destroyed. In **_Slay the Spire_**, while it lacks an in-play zone like **Magic** or **Hearthstone**, it still categorizes cards into zones like deck, hand, discard pile, and exhaust pile where cards are removed for the remainder of the game. There’s also likely an idea of a destroyed forever zone for cards permanently removed from play.

Fundamentally, the business logic of implementing a trading card game revolves around players acting on cards by moving them between zones, leading to interactions where the movement of one card affects others. This encapsulates the basic logic of trading card games: playing a card causes it to enter a new zone, and in doing so, triggers effects based on the card’s rules, the rules of other cards it influences, or the rules of cards that await an action to activate.

Every trading card game, in my opinion, can be distilled down to three primitive constructs: **cards**, **players**, and **zones**. Other constructs may exist in specific games, such as counters that modify cards in play, but the core basics are clear. You draw cards, you play cards, where "you" is the player, and this defines the fundamental nature of trading card games.

## Next Time

Now that we've established the sort of fundamental objects that exist in a trading card game and, in many respects, the fundamental actions that exist—which is the movement between zones of these cards and things like that—the next piece here is going to be to talk about how do you actually implement cards in a system like this. 

How do you conceptualize a computer system where you have zones, cards, players? What is the best way to implement cards? We'll actually walk through a bunch of examples of a theoretical game model on **_Hearthstone_**, where you have cards that you can play and those sorts of things, and walk through what it means to implement a card in that system, as well as some of the common pitfalls from a technical perspective that come up when you start trying to implement things like this.
