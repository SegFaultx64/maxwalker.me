      <h3>- About me -</h3>
      <em class="tagline">I build companies and products</em>
      <p>Ever since I was a little kid I have loved building things. What started as Lego eventually transformed into code, and by the time I was 12 I was hacking on opensource and installing Linux on stuff. I finally got to Skidmore College and dove into a CS education with both feet. I knew for sure I wanted to build software for a living when I stayed up for 3 days straight to build an emulator and assembler for a custom ISA I helped design.</p>
      <p>But I rapidly realized that I didn't <i>just</i> want to build things. By the time I graduated from school I had an itch for entrepreneurship. So without really knowing what I was getting myself into, I started my first startup journey. I was lucky enough to have an awesome array for mentors and friends who helped me along the way.</p>
      <p>Now days I help others get their companies and ideas off of the ground, in addition to working on my own. Along the way I accidentaly built a network of cool people in both startups and engineering, as well as building up expertise in a wide variety of spaces. My primary focuses are around data visualization, fintech, and SaaS companies, but I have been known to branch out as well.</p>
      <p class="last"><b>I would love to help you turn your concept into a living breathing company!</b></p>

          <br>
          <p>I founded Windrush in 2012 with the goal of building the next generation of data vizualization products. I assembled an awesome team and grew the company to 8 people. I built the platform from a blank slate into 150k LoC product deployed at scale. I raised a pre-seed and seed round of financing from both institutional and angel investors. I was responsible for day-to-day operations as well as strategy. I helped sell and deploy to awesome customers including some of the largest financial institutions in the world.</p>

          <p>I participated in the 2016 NYC Fintech class of Techstars. I got to spend <i>many</i> sleepless nights working on Windrush surrounded by 9 other awesome Fintech companies. I also got to walk on to DMX at demo day in front of more than 600 investors and bankers, which was pretty awesome. </p>

          <br>
          <p>I joined the Fashion Mingle team on a consulting basis in late 2015 to help the CEO Melissa bring her product to market. Her team had deep industry knowledge, but needed someone with a technology and startup background. I was able to advise on technical hiring building a scalable system archetecture, and fundraising strategy. Additionally I assisted in the day-to-day management of the technical team as well as setting sprint goals.</p>

          <p>I met with and assisted the Auxnation team from a very early stage. They are building an extremely interesing product with a great built in analytics play which peaked my interest. As soon as the opportunity arose I made a small angel investment in their pre-seed financing, and have continued to help them persue they technical and business goals.</p>
