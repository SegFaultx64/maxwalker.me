          <h3>- About me -</h3>
          <em class="tagline">I build companies and products</em>
          <p>Ever since I was a little kid I have loved building things. What started as Lego eventually transformed into code, and by the time I was 12 I was hacking on open source and installing Linux on stuff. I got to Skidmore College and dove into a CS education with both feet. I knew I wanted to build software for a living when I stayed up for 3 days straight to build an emulator and assembler for a custom ISA I helped design.</p>
          <p>But I rapidly realized that I didn't <i>just</i> want to build things. By the time I graduated from school I had an itch for entrepreneurship. So without really knowing what I was getting myself into, I began my first startup journey. I was lucky enough to have a remarkable array of mentors and friends who helped me along the way.</p>
          <p>Now a days I help others get their companies and ideas off the ground, in addition to working on my own company. Along the way, I had the good fortune to build a network of cool people in both startups and engineering, as well as building up expertise in a wide variety of spaces. My primary focuses are around data visualization, machine learning, and SaaS companies.</p>
          <p class="last"><b>I would love to help you turn your concept into a living, breathing company!</b></p>

              <p>I founded Windrush in 2013 with the goal of building the next generation of data visualization products. I assembled a skilled and dedicated team and grew the company to 8 people. I built the platform from a blank slate into 150k LoC product deployed at scale, and raised a pre-seed and seed round of financing from both institutional and angel investors. I was responsible for day-to-day operations as well as strategy. I helped sell and deploy to a wide array of customers, including some of the largest financial institutions in the world. Ultimately I guided to company to a sale to Kinetic in 2017.</p>

              <p>I participated in the 2016 NYC Fintech class of Techstars. I got to spend <i>many</i> sleepless nights working on Windrush surrounded by 9 other amazing Fintech companies.

              <p>I joined the Fashion Mingle team on a consulting basis in late 2015 to help the CEO Melissa bring her product to market.

Additionally, I assisted in the day-to-day management of the technical team, as well as setting sprint goals.</p>

              <p>I met with and assisted the Auxnation team from a very early stage. They are building an extremely interesting product with a great built-in analytics play, which peaked my interest. As soon as the opportunity arose, I made a small angel investment in their pre-seed financing, and have continued to help them pursue their technical and business goals.</p>
