          <h3>- Windrush -</h3>
          <em class="tagline">Telling stories with data</em>
          <p>Windrush was the venture-backed startup I founded during my senior year at Skidmore College in 2013 with classmates Mark
          Morrison (COO) and Riley Alsman (VP Sales). We started with only the vague idea of improving data visualization tools
          and little business experience between us.</p>
          
          <p>Over the next year we solidified the concept through a cycle of rapid prototyping and customer interviews, and
          ultimately settled on the idea of building a tool for data-driven storytelling. I raised an initial round of funding for
          this product and we were accepted to an accelerator in Cleveland, Ohio to expand our work on the tool we had developed.</p>
          
          <p>During this time, we refined our product and expanded the team. We focused our target market into two fairly narrow
          sectors: non-profit organizations and investment banks. The logic in this choice is that both segments have large
          amounts of data that needs to be translated into reports and limited in-house resources and skills to do so.
          Additionally, non-profit organizations have fairly quick sales cycles but tight budgets. Investment banks, on the other
          hand, have large amounts to spend on software purchasing but a very slow purchasing process.</p>

          <p>In summer 2016, Windrush was accepted into the highly competitive Techstars Fintech program in New York City. There I
          got even more hands-on experience working with bulge-bracket investment banks and the sometimes maddening technical and
          political complexity that entails. We further refined our product and moved towards a hybrid SaaS model. We coupled a
          low-barrier-to-entry self-service cloud-hosted offering with an enterprise onsite deployment option for sensitive
          financial data. Additionally, we integrated the Windrush product directly with Microsoft Excel at the request of our
          customers.</p>

          <p>Despite being extremely proud of the work we did and the product we built at Windrush, our revenue was simply not
          growing fast enough to secure a third round of funding. Ultimately the IP and parts of the team were acquired by KINETIC
          (a fellow Techstars alum), which wanted to integrate the lessons we learned building Windrush into their workplace
          analytics product. I joined their team as VP of Engineering and grew both the product and the team in my two years
          there.</p>

          <p></p>

          <em class="tagline">The Product</em>

          <p>The Windrush data storytelling product went through many series of revisions and improvements during its life. We built
          an extremely powerful and complex application using (at the time brand new) technologies such as React.js, D3.js, and
          Node.js. Additionally, we built a complex data ingestion and processing infrastructure on Scala and Hadoop along with
          Couchbase. By leveraging these technologies, we were able to build a powerful yet simple-to-use rich editor in the
          browser.</p>

          <p>Below is a brief video overview of the product:</p>
