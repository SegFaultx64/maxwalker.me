# About Me

Hey there! I'm Max Walker, the founder of Piton Labs, a tech consulting company that helps startups build their product. My experience in startups and my technical expertise as a software engineer make me the perfect guy to help founders get their companies off the ground. I've worked with big and small companies, but my true passion is helping startups succeed.
 
When I'm not working, I'm a traveler at heart, having been to over 34 countries and counting. I'm also a rock climber and hiker, and I own a vintage 1960s airstream trailer which I've lived in while traveling the US.

## Who I Help

I work primarily with startup founders, mostly CEOs, and CTOs between seed and Series B. I've worked across a variety of industries, but have a soft spot for fintech.

## How I Help

I help my clients with building their products, tech choices, hiring, and overall startup advice, with the goal of getting them to a point where they don't need me anymore.

## Why We're Different

What sets us apart at Piton Labs is our all-startup background and unique approach. Our team is senior+ developers who have tackled the toughest problems at early-stage startups.
