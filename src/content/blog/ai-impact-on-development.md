# Don't fall for the hype: The Real Impact of AI on Software Development

Many think AI tools will cut development costs by 50%. They're missing the point entirely.

After working with countless startups at Piton Labs, here's what I've learned:

**AI isn't a magic wand - it's a force multiplier.**

## The hard truth:

- A junior dev with ChatGPT won't build amazing products overnight
- Typing code was never the real bottleneck
- AI can't replace experience in system architecture

## What actually slows down development:

- Turning business requirements into working solutions
- Finding the right approach to complex problems
- Testing and iteration

## Where AI shines:

- Rapid prototyping
- Automating repetitive tasks
- Supporting experienced developers

Real example: What used to be a 2-week prototype with multiple engineers can now be an afternoon's work for one senior dev with AI tools.

But here's the catch:

Some tasks will be 90% faster.
Others won't speed up at all.

The key? AI tools are only as good as the people using them.

Think of it this way:
Bad decisions + AI = Wrong solutions, faster

Want to truly optimize development?
Focus on having the right people using the right tools for the right tasks.

What's your experience with AI-assisted development?
