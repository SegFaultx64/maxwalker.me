# Building MVPs That Actually Work for Startups

After years of helping startups build their first products, I've noticed a pattern: founders often misunderstand what "minimum viable" really means. 

## What a good MVP is (and isn't)

An MVP isn't just a stripped-down version of your dream product. It's a strategic tool designed to test your most critical assumptions with minimal investment.

The best MVPs focus on:

1. **Validating core value proposition** - Does your solution solve a real problem people care about?
2. **Learning, not perfection** - You should be slightly embarrassed by your first version
3. **Speed to market** - Weeks, not months
4. **Flexibility** - Easy to pivot based on feedback

## Common MVP mistakes I see founders make:

- Building for every edge case from day one
- Prioritizing nice-to-have features over must-haves
- Not defining clear success metrics before launch
- Overengineering the technical foundation
- Not talking to users until after the build

## How to approach your MVP smartly

Start with these questions:

1. What's the ONE thing you need to prove right now?
2. What's the fastest, cheapest way to test that?
3. What can you fake, outsource, or build manually?

Remember, an MVP that takes 6 months to build isn't minimum. The goal is to get something in users' hands quickly, gather feedback, and iterate.

What's been your experience with building MVPs? Did you start too big or too small?
