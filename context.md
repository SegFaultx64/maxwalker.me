AboutAbout
Hey there! I'm Max Walker, the founder of Piton Labs, a tech consulting company that helps startups build their product. My experience in startups and my technical expertise as a software engineer make me the perfect guy to help founders get their companies off the ground. I've worked with big and small companies, but my true passion is helping startups succeed.
 
When I'm not working, I'm a traveler at heart, having been to over 34 countries and counting. I'm also a rock climber and hiker, and I own a vintage 1960s airstream trailer which I've lived in while traveling the US.
 
Who I help
 
I work primarily with startup founders, mostly CEOs, and CTOs between seed and Series B. I've worked across a variety of industries, but have a soft spot for fintech. 
 
How I help
 
I help my clients with building their products, tech choices, hiring, and overall startup advice, with the goal of getting them to a point where they don't need me anymore.
 
Why are we different
 
What sets us apart at Piton Labs is our all-startup background and unique approach. Our team is senior+ developers who have tackled the toughest problems at early-stage startups.
 
⭐ How to contact me
 
If you're interested in working with me, the best way to get in touch is through LinkedIn or by sending me an email at max@pitonlabs.com. Looking forward to hearing from you!Hey there!

Don't fall for the hype: The real impact of AI on software development.

Many think AI tools will cut development costs by 50%. They're missing the point entirely.

After working with countless startups at Peton Labs, here's what I've learned:

AI isn't a magic wand - it's a force multiplier.

The hard truth:

• A junior dev with ChatGPT won't build amazing products overnight
• Typing code was never the real bottleneck
• AI can't replace experience in system architecture

What actually slows down development:

• Turning business requirements into working solutions
• Finding the right approach to complex problems
• Testing and iteration

Where AI shines:

• Rapid prototyping
• Automating repetitive tasks
• Supporting experienced developers

Real example:
What used to be a 2-week prototype with multiple engineers can now be an afternoon's work for one senior dev with AI tools.

But here's the catch:

Some tasks will be 90% faster.
Others won't speed up at all.

The key? AI tools are only as good as the people using them.

Think of it this way:
Bad decisions + AI = Wrong solutions, faster

Want to truly optimize development?
Focus on having the right people using the right tools for the right tasks.

What's your experience with AI-assisted development?
